irssi-MQTT-notify
=================

My MQTT notification script, based on my Jabber/XMPP notification script:
https://github.com/dm8tbr/irssi-xmpp-notify

This script requires the Mosquitto client tools, specifically 'mosquitto_pub',
to work.

See https://github.com/dm8tbr/irssi-mqtt-sailfish for client side implementations.
